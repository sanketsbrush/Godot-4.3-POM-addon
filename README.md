Parallax Occlusion Mapping or POM in short , is a node made based on multimeshinstance3d . 
It uses combination of MultimeshInstance3D instances as layers , and depth map as alpha map , for each layer to create depth effect.
I made this because I felt like Godot's StandardMaterial3D's Deep Parallax is not good enough for convex meshes.
