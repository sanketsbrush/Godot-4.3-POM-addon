Parallax Occlusion Mapping or POM in short , 
is a node made based on multimeshinstance3d . 
It uses combination of MultimeshInstance3D instances as layers , and depth map as alpha map for each layer to create depth effect.
I made this because I feel Godot's StandardMaterial3D's Deep Parallax isn't good enough for convex meshes
